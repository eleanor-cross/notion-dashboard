 Duke Law Dashboard - Project Description
Executive Summary
The Duke Law Dashboard is a web application designed to bridge the gap between Notion's powerful database capabilities and the need for real-time, interactive study tracking tools. This application transforms static Notion databases into a dynamic productivity ecosystem specifically tailored for law school students, providing instant time tracking, intelligent reading analytics, and seamless task management.
ðŸŽ¯ Project Vision
To create a unified, intelligent dashboard that eliminates the friction between planning and execution in law school studies, allowing students to focus on learning rather than logging.
ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
Current Pain Points:

Manual Time Tracking: Students must manually create time tracking entries in Notion, disrupting study flow
Disconnected Tools: Timer widgets can't access actual task names or reading assignments from Notion databases
Lack of Real-time Analytics: No immediate feedback on reading speed per textbook or time spent per class
Fragmented Workflow: Switching between Notion for planning and external tools for tracking
Missing Predictive Insights: No way to estimate reading time based on historical performance with specific textbooks

User Story:
"As a Duke Law student, I need to track my study time without interrupting my flow, see how long my readings actually take versus estimates, and understand my productivity patterns across different subjects - all while keeping Notion as my central planning hub."
ðŸŽ¯ Core Objectives
1. Seamless Integration

Direct read/write access to Notion databases
Automatic synchronization of tasks, textbooks, and schedules
No duplicate data entry required

2. Frictionless Time Tracking

One-click timer start/stop
Automatic task association
Background creation of time tracking entries

3. Intelligent Analytics

Per-textbook reading speed calculations
Class-specific time analysis
Predictive time estimates for upcoming readings

4. Student-Centric Design

Optimized for law school workflow
Quick access to frequent tasks (email, reading, briefing)
Visual feedback that motivates consistent tracking

ðŸ”§ Key Features & Goals
Phase 1: Core Functionality (MVP)
Active Task Timer
Goal: Enable zero-friction time tracking

Pull active tasks from Notion Tasks database
Start/stop creates entries in Time Tracking database
Visual countdown/countup display
Keyboard shortcuts (spacebar to toggle)

Quick Task Buttons
Goal: Rapid logging of routine activities

Pre-configured law school tasks (Check Email, Case Brief, Outline)
One-tap start/stop
Daily session summary
Visual indication of active task

Reading Tracker
Goal: Understand actual vs. estimated reading time

Select from Notion Textbooks database
Log pages read with automatic speed calculation
Track by class and textbook separately
Historical data for better planning

Phase 2: Analytics & Insights
Performance Dashboard
Goal: Data-driven study optimization

Reading speed trends per textbook
Time distribution across classes
Weekly/monthly progress visualization
Comparison of estimated vs. actual time

Predictive Planning
Goal: Accurate time budgeting

Calculate time needed based on textbook-specific speed
Weekly workload forecasting

Phase 3: Advanced Features
Mood & Energy Tracking
Goal: Optimize study schedule

Post-class mood logging
Energy level correlation with productivity
Best times for different types of work

Smart Notifications
Goal: Gentle productivity nudges

Reminder to start timer
Break suggestions based on study duration
Weekly summary reports

ðŸ“Š Success Metrics
Quantitative Goals:

Reduce time tracking friction by 90% (from ~30 seconds to ~3 seconds)
Capture 80%+ of actual study time (vs. current ~20% estimate)
Improve reading time predictions to within 15% accuracy
Save 30+ minutes per week on administrative tasks

Qualitative Goals:

Students feel more in control of their time
Reduced anxiety about workload planning
Increased motivation through progress visualization
Better work-life balance through accurate time awareness
